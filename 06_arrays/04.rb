#4  What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
# Returns 8  -- INCORRECT.  Didn't understand this method.
# CORRECT answer is 3
# b/c the 'index()' method takes your argument and returns
# the INDEX of the FIRST matched element in the array. So, even tho there are two 5s in the arr array,
# the first 5 is at index 3.

2. arr.index[5]
# Error ?   -- CORRECT

3. arr[5]
# Returns 8  -- CORRECT
