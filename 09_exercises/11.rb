# Look at several Rails/Ruby online documentation sources and say which one you like best and why.

# Not loving ruby-doc.org yet, but may just need to get used to it. I think it's the interface/layout.
# But I also haven't spent a ton of time with programming language documentation just yet, so it may be that also.
# I also find stackoverflow.com helpful for typically quick lookups or answers,
# usually b/c it's first in the Google results and the answer is typically easy to find within the page (based on votes).

# I just checked out docs.ruby-lang.org as well, and that intuitively feels better off the bat for me (just seemed clearer
# to understand and navigate off the bat.) But I would have to use this one and ruby-docs.org in more depth when I'm
# working to understand which is actually better and provides the most usefulness and accuracy ?

# I haven't found any others just yet.
