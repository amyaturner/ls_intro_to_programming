# Q: What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
# A: The major difference is that an array uses an index to identify an element's value, and the index
# starts at 0. Whereas a hash uses key-value pairs, and the key is generally named with a :symbol
# (which almost never changes after it's been set.)
